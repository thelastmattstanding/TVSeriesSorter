Hey! If you're reading this, then I probably forced you to check it out or somehow you took an interest in my (incomplete) program!

So this is a program to sort a tv series season-wise and renames your episodes to their corresponding titles.
When they ask you to enter to a path, enter the path of the folder containing your episodes. OTherwise, it won't work.
It might take more time depending upon your internet connection, number of seasons and number of files in the folder. 
The program ignores all files which don't have extensions pertaining to media.
It does scan all subfolders in the folder as well to obtain all media files. 


Before you use this program, you must understand that currently it is,
a) Not efficient enough
b) Contains several flaws
c) Will be improved upon as time passes (I know this one is kinda stupid)
d) Have not added comments to the program yet! Will work on that!


Alright, possible errors you need to know about -

a) It makes use of IMDB for your episode names, so if the tv show is not there on IMDB, it won't work
b) For proper key generation and matching, it needs each episode filename to include some sort of indicator 
as to what episode it is, i.e., the filename should include terms like "s01e01" or "1x1", or "Season 1 Episode 1", etc
c) It currently generates errors if there are two files with the same name (need to work on that!)
d) Needs Internet connectivity (obviously for IMDB!)
e) The folder cotaining the episodes must be renamed to the proper name of the series as the foldername is used to search on IMDB
f) Can raise a "KEY ERROR" for certain shows (possibly due to IMDB. Will work on it!)
